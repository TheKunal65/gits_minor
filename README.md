# Space Information Chatbot

## Brief Description
The project is a chatbot application designed to provide users with detailed and accurate information about space. The app leverages Gemini, Google's advanced large language model (LLM), to access a wide array of space-related data. The application is built using the Flutter framework, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience across multiple platforms. State management is efficiently handled by the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern, and engaging animations are incorporated using Lottie.

## Objective and Scope
### Objective
